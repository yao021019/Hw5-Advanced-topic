# AI Content Detector

This is a Streamlit web application that analyzes text to detect whether it was likely written by a human or generated by an AI. The detection is based on linguistic features like "Perplexity" and "Burstiness".

## Features

-   **AI Probability Score:** Get a percentage score indicating the likelihood of the text being AI-generated.
-   **Text Highlighting:** See which sentences are flagged as more likely to be AI or human-written.
-   **Perplexity Analysis:** View a chart of the text's "perplexity" over time.
-   **Burstiness Analysis:** See the distribution of sentence lengths.
-   **Detailed Metrics:** Get statistics like sentence count, word count, and the overall burstiness score.

## How it Works

The application uses a simulated model based on the following concepts:

-   **Perplexity:** AI-generated text tends to have a lower and more consistent perplexity (less "surprising" to a language model).
-   **Burstiness:** Human writing often has more variation in sentence length and structure (higher "burstiness"), while AI text can be more uniform.

The app combines these metrics to produce a final probability score.
